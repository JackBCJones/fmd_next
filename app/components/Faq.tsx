            q: "How will I know if I meet all the requirements?",
            answer: "The best way to assure that you meet the requirements is to carefully read what is needed on FindMyDegree.co.za and the course description information on the universityâ€™s website and submit everything that is listed. You can find a link to the university's course information by searching for the course and then clicking 'Show more' in the search result. You'll find a link to the course description page. You can also find a link on your application page."

            id: 4,
            q: "what if i failed a matric subject?",
